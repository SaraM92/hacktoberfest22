## Beginner Friendly Repositories:

<br />
If you’re into data science and ML, chances are you’ve used or at least come across these before, making them excellent starting points.

- [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): Transformers is a really popular library by HuggingFace for BERT based models. You can start contributing by checking their [Good First Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) tag and or their [Good Difficult Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/labels/Good%20Difficult%20Issue) if you are familiar with their codebase.

- [scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn): Sklearn is a staple Python library for anyone doing Machine Learning, allowing you to do regression analysis, clustering, classification and more. They’re developing rapidly, and open to new hands on deck. You can find the GitHub page for their contributing guideline tag [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas): This flexible and powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python has an active community, with news updates on their blog. [Here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) is an overview on how you can start contributing.

- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch): A Machine Learning framework that accelerates your ML pipeline from prototyping to deployment. This is a really advanced community with many channels of interaction. I’d say this is a great one to contribute to. They have a really detailed contributing guideline that you can find [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Projects for more Advanced Contributors
If you have some open-source experience, you can consider contributing to these projects:

- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy): While not really an ML-specific library, numpy offers powerful numerical computing tools that often go hand-in-hand with data science work in Python. They seem to value their community, judging by their website, which is a good sign for new contributors. You can find the GitHub page for their [good first issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/good%20first%20issue) tag.

- [matplotlib](): The Python data visualisation library we know and love. Their website has very comprehensive [contribution guidelines](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/contributing.html). You can find the GitHub page for their good first issue tag [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels/Good%20first%20issue).
