# Beginner Friendly Repositories:

<br />
If you’re into data science and ML, chances are you’ve used or at least come across these before, making them excellent starting points.

## scikit-Learn
Sklearn is a staple Python library for anyone doing Machine Learning, allowing you to do regression analysis, clustering, classification and more. They’re developing rapidly, and open to new hands on deck. You can find the GitHub page for their “good first issues” tag here.

## numpy
While not really an ML-specific library, numpy offers powerful numerical computing tools that often go hand-in-hand with data science work in Python. They seem to value their community, judging by their website, which is a good sign for new contributors.You can find the GitHub page for their “good first issue” tag here.

## matplotlib
The Python data visualisation library we know and love. Their website has very comprehensive contribution guidelines. You can find the GitHub page for their “good first issue” tag here.

## pandas
This flexible and powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python has an active community, with news updates on their blog. You can find the GitHub page for their “good first issue” tag here.

## PyTorch
A Machine Learning framework that accelerates the pipeline from prototyping to deployment. This is a really advanced community with many channels of interaction. I’d say this is a great one to contribute to. You can find the GitHub page for their “good first issue” tag here.
