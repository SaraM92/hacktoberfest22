# How to make your project ready for HacktoberFest

Participating in HacktoberFest as a maintainer is a great way to get volunteers and contributors to help build and grow your project. Here is a quick checklist that you can use to make your project HacktoberFest friendly:

- [ ] First you need to let potential HacktoberFest contributors know that you are participating in HacktoberFest and that your project needs help. To do that, add the `Hacktoberfest` topics to your project. To do that, click on the gear icon to the right side of the About section on your repository's main page. Then add the topic!
- [ ] Next you need to help folks know where they can contribute by pointing them to tasks or issues that you need help with. To do that, apply the `Hacktoberfest` label to issues in your repository. To do that, click on the Issues tab (you will find this below your repo name), then click on the Labels button besides the search bar and click the green New label button!
- [ ] Finally, you need to add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to your repo with instructions for how to contribute to your project. Contributing to new projects can seem like an uphill task, especially for new open-source contributors. Adding a contributing guideline will further help contributors to get started!



## Recommendations on Accepting Contributions

Once you make your project ready for HacktoberFest, you might find your project getting a lot of PRs or you might have folks reaching out to you for help. This might feel overwhelming. Here are some recommendations to help make the process smoother for you.

- [ ] Make sure that the issues you created are descriptive and have well-defined scopes and objectives. This will help contributors get started with the issue and they will know exactly what to fix. Issues with unclear requirements or goals can make it difficult for folks to know whether their work meets the objective of the issue
- [ ] Add a Code of Conduct to your repository. You can create your own code of conduct or choose one from a template. To do that click Add file and then Create new file in your repository's main page. then type `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`in the name of the file and code a template!
- [ ] Finally, once you see contributions comming in, make sure to review PRs and give contributors helpful comments. This will keep them motivated to continue contributing! You may also see some invalid or spammy PRs. Feel free to invalidate them and mark them as `invalid` or `spam`.

## Maintainer Recognition

As a maintainer you are going to be doing some really hard work helping folks and reviewing PRs. You should be recognized for that!

Thankfully this time HacktoberFest will also send a t-shirt pack to maintainers as well! To get it, make sure that you register as a maintainer for HacktoberFest and approve or invalidate at least 4 PR. You can also add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label or the `invalid`/`spam` label to PRs.



We hope this guide will help you get started with becoming a maintainer for HacktoberFest. We can't wait to see the projects you will build!
